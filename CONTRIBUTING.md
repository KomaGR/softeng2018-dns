## Guidelines
Here is a short list of guidelines (adapted from [TypeScript Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines)). This is not an exhaustive guide, so please be willing to make requested modifications to your code.

### General
* Open pull requests against the `<feature>` branch.
* When appropriate, encapsulate your code in its own class, in its own file.

### Names

* Use lowercase for branch names.
* Use lowercase for directories (do not capitalize first).
* Use PascalCase for file names. 
* Use whole words, not abbreviations, in names.
* Use PascalCase for type names and public methods.
* Use camelCase for local variables and private properties.

### Commits

* Use only English in commit messages.
* Use present tense (e.g. "Fix error" and not "Fixed error")
* Use imperative. "Fix", "Add", "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", "Changed".
* Don't end the summary line with a period.
